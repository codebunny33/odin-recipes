    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      BBQ Shrimp from a restaurant in New Orleans. Don't let the name fool you:
      the shrimp isn't grilled with a sweet barbecue sauce; it's simmered in a
      butter and Worcestershire sauce.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>

      <li>¼ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>

      <li>¼ teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®)</li>

      <li>2 pounds uncooked large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>

      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with
        foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix melted butter, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, pepper, Cajun
        seasoning, and Tabasco sauce together in a small bowl.
      </li>

      <li>
        Rinse shrimp in a colander and pat dry with paper towels to remove the
        excess water. Place in a large bowl.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add minced garlic to the bowl with the shrimp. Pour in butter sauce and
        toss with the shrimp and garlic. Pour shrimp and sauce onto the prepared
        sheet pan, and spread shrimp out into an even layer.
      </li>

      <li>
        Cook in the pre-heated oven until the shrimp turn pink (be careful not
        to overcook), about 8 minutes. Serve with the sauce from the pan and
        French bread for dipping.
      </li>
    </ol>
